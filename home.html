      <h2 class="mt-5">Overview</h2>
        <p>
          The process of observing users interacting with an interface, interviewing these users,
          creating personas based on these users, and creating a storyboard based on a persona is
          a classic UX task. As a student of CS1300 (UI/UX), our first assignment was to experience this entire
          process to better understand what UI/UX designers do.

        <p>
          I chose my appartment's washing machine because I think it has a relatively complex and interesting interface. 
          I then asked a couple of close friends to interact with my washing machine so that I could learn more about its interface.
        </p>
      <h2 class="mt-5">My Interface</h2>

        <p>
          This washing machine interface allows users to select and customize
          different preset clothes washing programs. Besides the basic components 
          present on all washing machines such as a door, a power button, etc., 
          the washing machine also provides a dial and a variety of buttons so that
          users can choose a specific program and then customize said program.
        </p>
      <h2 class="mt-5">Observations</h2>
        <p>
          I choose my users because I knew they had never interacted with this
          specific washing machine interface before. Therefore, I felt they would
          be able to give an unbiased viewpoint. Unfortunately, due to COVID-19
          restrictions, my choice of users was not as representative of the
          general user population as I would have liked.
        </p>
        <p>The following is a summary of my observations of 3 different users.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            All 3 users hesitated when trying to turn the machine on. All 3
            incorrectly pressed the power button multiple times. One user even 
            accidentally turned the machine off again as they had not realized 
            they already turned the machine on. 
          </li>
          <li>
            None of the users hesitated when adding soap to the laundary detergent
            compartment. They deftly opened the compartment and added the detergent.
          </li>
          <li>
            Users did not hestitate when selecting the main washing program.
            They quickly navigated the initial program selection menu. However,
            they did hesitate and slow down when presented with the secondary
            options menu.
          </li>
          <li>
            All 3 users did not hesitate when starting the washing cycle. None
            of them pressed the button multiple times or accidentally paused
            the wash cycle.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>User 1</h4>
        <blockquote class="blockquote">
          <p class="mb-0">"I think they were more focused on how to fit as many 
            features as possible that they didnâ€™t think about how easy it would 
            be to toggle those options."
          </p>
          <footer class="blockquote-footer">User 1</footer>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          User 1 said they found the washing machine very difficult to turn on.
          They said the interface did not make much sense, and although the
          power button was clearly labeled, the fact that the button did not
          offer any tactile feedback made it impossible to tell if pressing
          the button had any result. User 1 said that other washing machines
          they have used in the past had much fewer options, but they thought
          this simplification made those interfaces more intuitive. User 1
          said to improve the interface of this washing machine, they would
          reduce the number of buttons present and would use buttons that
          provided tactile feedback.
        </p>
        <h4>User 2</h4>
        <p>
          User 2 also said they found the machine difficult to turn on. Also,
          starting the machine was easy, but pausing the machine was difficult
          as it required using a different keypress on the same button, which was
          unintuitive. They also said previous washing machines they have used
          had fewer features, but were also easier to use due to the simpler
          interface. User 2 said to improve the interface, they would either
          reduce the number of options on the machine or create a companion
          app that provided a fully interactive interface for the washing machine.
        </p>
        <h4>User 3</h4>
        <blockquote class="blockquote">
          <p class="mb-0">"The machine looks nice, but it doesn't have an
            intuitive interface."
          </p>
          <footer class="blockquote-footer">User 3</footer>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          User 3 found the machine unintuitive to start up and also found the
          graphic labels on the machine unclear. They said other washing machines
          they used had fewer options and were thus easier to use. Furthermore,
          they also found the grouping of options on the machine to be
          unintuitive. User 3 said they would change the start button to provide
          some kind of feedback, either visual or tactile, so that a user can tell
          if the machine is in the process of turning on. They would also change
          the grouping of buttons on the interface.
