      <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          The process of observing users interacting with an interface, interviewing these users,
          creating personas based on these users, and creating a storyboard based on a persona is
          a classic UX task. As a student of CS1300 (UI/UX), our first assignment was to experience this entire
          process to better understand what UI/UX designers do.

          Unfortunately, COVID-19 has made it a bit more difficult to observe public interfaces. 
          As a compromise, I chose my appartment's washing machine because I think it has a
          relatively complex and interesting interface. I then asked a couple of close friends
          to interact with my washing machine so that I could go through the same process.
